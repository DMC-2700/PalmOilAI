How It Works:
The program uses Tensorflow and different classes to train a primitive AI to determine the ripness of a palm oil fruit in an example image. The program will first train the model and print a table of the values of the training. Additionally, the program will print a table with the model accuracy using individual Epochs. Verifications will be implimented further in more commits in the future. For now the model is an exetremly primitve version of the final product.
